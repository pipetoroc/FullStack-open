# Bootcamp FullStack-open
Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

# Project Overview
This project was created to accompany and study the FullStack Open bootcamp by the University of Helsinki.

## Technologies
During the bootcamp, various technologies are utilized, including:
- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- TypeScript. 

Through this course, I am learning modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single-page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Structure

The bootcamp content is divided into sections, with each directory containing the proposed exercises. Each topic within the exercises is divided into separate commits.
